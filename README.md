## Vaxxometer Workshop, 12/02/2021

### Carry over work from 1st workshop

Make sure you have appropriate changes in:

- lib/main.dart
- test/widget_test.dart
- pubspec.yaml

The project zip file is here: https://github.com/vishna/workshop_vaxxometer/archive/main.zip

### Adaptive Layout

We want to replace FAB button with something that has better UX. We'll use:

- [Bottom Bar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html) (for screens with portrait/square ratio)
- [Navigation Rail](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/NavigationRail-class.html) (for screens with landscape ratio)
